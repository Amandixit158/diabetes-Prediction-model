Diabetes Prediction System – Project Description

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical parameters. Diabetes is a chronic disease, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe health complications. This project aims to assist doctors and individuals by providing a quick and reliable prediction using data-driven techniques.

The system uses a supervised machine learning model trained on a diabetes dataset containing features such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, and other health indicators. After training, the model learns patterns from historical data and uses them to make accurate predictions for new users.

A Python Flask backend is used to handle model loading, data processing, and prediction logic. The user-friendly frontend interface allows users to enter their health details easily and receive instant prediction results. The application ensures simplicity so that even non-technical users can operate it without difficulty.

This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in healthcare, highlighting how technology can support medical decision-making and improve early diagnosis. It also showcases skills in data preprocessing, model training, backend integration, and web application development.
